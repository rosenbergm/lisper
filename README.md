# Run

If you run `lisper`, you will be thrown into a REPL where you can try out the language.

To run a file containing Lisper code, run `lisper <path to file>`. You can check out the `examples` folder.

# Development setup

You will need [the Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
to compile this codebase. This will install `cargo`, the Rust package manager.

## Building

Run `cargo build` to build an executable. No environment variables are needed.

## Running from source

Run `cargo run` to run the program.
